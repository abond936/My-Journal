# CSS Standards

## File Organization
- All styles MUST be in `src/styles/`
- Component styles MUST be in `src/styles/components/`
- Global styles MUST be in `src/styles/globals.css`
- Theme styles MUST be in `src/styles/themes/`
- Utility styles MUST be in `src/styles/utils/`

## Naming Conventions
- CSS Module files MUST use `.module.css` extension
- Global CSS files MUST use `.css` extension
- Theme files MUST use `[name].theme.css`
- Utility files MUST use `[name].utils.css`

## Class Naming
- Use kebab-case for class names
- Use BEM methodology for component classes
- Prefix utility classes with `u-`
- Prefix layout classes with `l-`
- Prefix theme classes with `t-`

## CSS Module Usage
- MUST use CSS Modules for component styles
- MUST use camelCase for imported class names
- MUST use meaningful class names
- MUST avoid global class names in modules

## Variables and Theming
- MUST use CSS variables for theming
- MUST define variables in `:root`
- MUST use semantic variable names
- MUST provide fallback values
- MUST use global variables for:
  - Colors
  - Spacing
  - Typography
  - Breakpoints
  - Z-indices
  - Transitions
  - Shadows
  - Border radiuses
- MUST avoid local variable definitions unless absolutely necessary
- MUST document all global variables in `globals.css`

## Media Queries
- MUST use fluid/gradient responsiveness instead of breakpoints
- MUST use CSS calc() for fluid typography
- MUST use viewport units (vw, vh) for fluid layouts
- MUST use clamp() for responsive values
- MUST use min(), max() for responsive constraints
- MUST avoid fixed breakpoints except for:
  - Mobile menu toggles
  - Layout shifts
  - Component stacking
- MUST document any necessary breakpoints

## Style Overrides
- MUST avoid style overrides
- MUST use CSS custom properties for dynamic values
- MUST use data attributes for state-based styling
- MUST use CSS cascade instead of specificity
- MUST use composition over inheritance
- MUST use utility classes for one-off styles
- MUST document any necessary overrides

## Performance
- MUST minimize selector specificity
- MUST avoid !important
- MUST use efficient selectors
- MUST minimize style duplication

## Accessibility
- MUST maintain minimum color contrast
- MUST provide focus states
- MUST support reduced motion
- MUST use relative units

## Documentation
- MUST document complex styles
- MUST explain non-obvious solutions
- MUST document breakpoints
- MUST maintain style guide

## Best Practices
- MUST use flexbox/grid for layouts
- MUST use CSS variables for repeated values
- MUST use logical properties
- MUST support RTL layouts
- MUST use modern CSS features
- MUST provide fallbacks for older browsers

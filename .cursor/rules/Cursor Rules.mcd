# Cursor Development Rules

## 1. Problem-Solving Protocol
- Consider all coding recommendation 
- Check existing codebase before proposing solutions
- Review current architecture before making changes
- Consider long-term implications
- Obtain explicit approval before writing new code

## 2. Communication Rules
- Present plans before making changes
- Document issues when they arise
- Keep track of important decisions
- Maintain clear problem statements

## 3. Development Process
- Focus on one issue at a time
- Document decisions and learnings
- Follow established patterns
- Test as you go

## 4. Code Creation Rules
- Check existing solutions first
- Document proposed changes
- Get approval before implementation
- Follow established patterns

## 5. Documentation Requirements
- Maintain a detailed Executive Summary of the Project
- Maintain a detailed Vision of the Project
- Maintain a detailed Architecture Plan
- Maintain a detailed Development Plan
- Update all documentation as decisions and coding is made.


## 6. Interaction Patterns
- Listen before acting
- Ask clarifying questions
- Present plans for approval
- Document important information

## 7. File Management
- Keep track of file changes
- Document file purposes
- Maintain clear organization
- Follow naming conventions

## 8. Session Management
- Review current state at start
- Document important decisions
- Track progress
- Maintain context

## 9. Emergency Protocol
- Document issues clearly
- Propose solutions
- Get approval before changes
- Maintain clear communication

## 10. Learning and Adaptation
- Document learnings
- Track patterns
- Share knowledge
- Improve processes

## 11. Next.js Routing Standards
- Use consistent parameter names across routes
- Follow the pattern: `[id]` for single-item routes
- Document route parameters in architecture
- Check for existing routes before creating new ones
- Use server components by default
- Document any client components with clear reasoning

## 12. Parameter Naming Conventions
- Use `id` for single-item identifiers
- Use `categoryId` only in data models, not routes
- Document parameter names in architecture
- Maintain consistency with database field names
- Review parameter usage across components

## 13. Component Development
- Start with server components by default
- Document reasons for client components
- Follow established patterns
- Include proper TypeScript interfaces
- Implement proper error handling

## 14. Code Style and Organization

### Naming Conventions
- Use camelCase for JavaScript variables and function names
- Use PascalCase for React component names
- Use kebab-case for CSS class names
- Use descriptive and meaningful names for all entities
- Be consistent with naming throughout the project

### Code Formatting
- Maintain consistent indentation (2 spaces)
- Keep lines of code reasonably short (80-120 characters)
- Use blank lines to separate logical blocks of code
- Be consistent with the use of semicolons
- Format code according to project's ESLint configuration

### Comments and Documentation
- Add comments to explain complex logic or non-obvious code
- Use JSDoc-style comments for functions and components
- Keep comments up-to-date with code changes
- Document important decisions and their rationale
- Include usage examples for complex components

### File Structure
- Adhere to Next.js directory structure
- Organize components by feature or shared utility
- Keep page-specific components within pages directory
- Maintain clear separation of concerns
- Follow consistent file organization patterns

### CSS Organization
- Use logical CSS file organization
- Follow BEM methodology for class names
- Keep specificity as low as possible
- Avoid excessive selector nesting
- Use media queries for responsiveness
- Document complex CSS rules

### Data Management
- Use appropriate Next.js data fetching methods
- Centralize data fetching logic
- Implement proper error handling
- Follow consistent patterns for data access
- Document data flow and transformations

### API Design
- Keep API route handlers focused and concise
- Implement proper error handling and validation
- Follow RESTful conventions
- Document endpoints and request/response formats
- Use consistent authentication patterns

### Testing Strategy
- Write tests for critical functionality
- Follow consistent testing patterns
- Include unit, integration, and E2E tests
- Document test coverage requirements
- Maintain test data and fixtures

### Environment and Configuration
- Use .env files for configuration
- Never commit sensitive information
- Document required environment variables
- Follow consistent configuration patterns
- Validate environment setup

## 15. Documentation Rules

### Location
- All project documentation must be stored in the `/docs` directory
- No documentation files should be placed in the root directory
- Documentation should be organized by type and purpose
- Each document should have a clear, descriptive name

### Naming Conventions
- Use PascalCase for document names
- Include the document type in the name (e.g., `ARCHITECTURE.md`, `VISION.md`)
- Use descriptive names that indicate the document's purpose

### Content Organization
- Each document should have a clear structure with sections and subsections
- Use markdown formatting consistently
- Include a table of contents for longer documents
- Keep related information together in the same document

### Version Control
- Document changes should be committed with clear, descriptive messages
- Major changes should be noted in the document's history
- Keep documentation in sync with code changes

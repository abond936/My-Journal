# AI Interaction Guide

## Prime Directive
- Your single most important task is to gain my explicit approval before performing any action that changes the codebase. 
- This includes writing code, editing files, creating files, installing dependencies, or running commands. 
- You may read code for assessment and recommendation, BUT...
- You must always wait for me to say "proceed", "yes", or "y" before taking action to modify or add code.

## Our Workflow
Follow this four-step process for every task:

1.  Assess the situation
    - First, understand my request.
    - Search/read the codebase to see if a solution already exists.
    - Formulate a concise, explanation of the situation.
    
2. Recommend a course of action
    - Prepare and present a clear, summary of options
    - State your recommendation for action clearly 
    - Explain why this is the right approach.

3. Seek approval
    - Explicitly ask for my approval. 
      - Examples: 
        - "Does this plan look correct? Awaiting your approval."
        - "Do you agree with this plan of action? May I proceed?

4.  Execute (Only After Approval):
    - Once I have replied with "proceed", "yes", or "y", you may execute the plan.
    - If you encounter an unexpected or new issue during execution, stop immediately and return to Step 1.

## Interaction Examples

### 🟢 Good Interaction
> **Me:** "We received this error message."
>
> **You:** "Okay. This is why we received that error. Here is the fix for that error. Does this plan meet your approval?"
>
> **Me:** "Yes, approved."
>
> **You:** *(Calls the `edit_file` tool for `src/components/common/Button.tsx`)*

### 🔴 Bad Interaction
> **Me:** "We received this error message."
>
> **You:** "Yes, I will now make the correction" *(Immediately calls the `edit_file` tool without waiting for approval.)*

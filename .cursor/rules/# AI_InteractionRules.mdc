  - You may read code for assessment and recommendation, BUT...
  - MAKE NO CHANGES OR ADDITIONS TO THE CODEBASE OR DIRECTORY/FILE STRUCTURE WITHOUT MY EXPLICIT APPROVAL--EVER!
  - I REPEAT
  - DO NOT make ANY changes, additions or reverts to the codebase or directory/file structure without my explicit approval—EVER.
  
  - Once approved, ONLY edit code DIRECTLY related to the current question/issue. 
  - Do not change unrelated code, comments, or structure.
  - If unsure about scope or location, stop and ask for clarification and approval.

You will follow this four-step process for every task without exception:

1.  Assess the situation
    - Understand my request.
    - Search/read/understand the full codebase to understand the architecture and the specific implementation.
    - Formulate a solution that is compatible with existing architecture and code.
        - If the solution has implications for existing code, explain its implications
    
2. Recommend a course of action
    - Prepare and present a clear, summary of options
    - State your recommendation for action clearly 
    - Explain why this is the right approach.
    - If the recommendation has implications for other architecture or code, explain it's implicatons.

3. Seek approval
    - Explicitly ask for my approval. 
      - Example: 
        - "Do you agree with this plan of action? May I proceed?

4.  Execute (Only After Approval):
    - Once I have approved, you may execute the plan.
    - If you encounter an unexpected or new issue during execution, stop immediately and return to Step 1.

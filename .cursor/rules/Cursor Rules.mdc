# ADHERENCE TO RULES
- To keep the project organized and facilitate our efficient and effective interaction, it is critical to adhere to our defined rules of engagement and development. 
- There is no excuse for not following out established rules. 
- Failure to follow the standards and rules will be met with quick disapproval.


## Core Principles
1. Always check for existence anywhere in the codebase before creating
2. Always show planned changes before execution
3. Always ask and wait for permission before modifying or creating any file or directory
4. Always work within and maintain the established directory structure standards
5. A question is not a request to do anything. It seeks information only.
4. Offer to remove un-needed files and directories 

## File Management
- ALWAYS get explicit permission before creating, modifying, moving, deleting files or directories


## Coding Standards
1. Routing and Structure
   - Use app/ directory for routing (not pages/)
   - Follow Next.js 14 app router conventions
   - Maintain component hierarchy in src/components

2. Implement Error Handling and Logging in all code.
   - Implement try/catch blocks for all async operations
   - Log errors with context and stack traces
   - Use consistent error message format
   - Include error boundaries for React components

3. Document Code as Education to tool
   - Include JSDoc for functions and components
   - Document code and business logic
   - Keep comments up-to-date with code changes


## CSS Core Principles
1. Use Global Variables for all Theming and Styling
     - Colors (light/dark)
     - Typography (size, weight, line-height)
     - Spacing
     - Breakpoints
     - Transitions
     - Z-indices
     - Shadows
     - Border radiuses
     - Avoid style overrides

2. Use Fluid Responsiveness
   - Use fluid/gradient responsiveness instead of breakpoints


## Configuration
  - Environment files MUST be in root directory
  - Build config MUST be in root directory
  - TypeScript config MUST be in root directory
  - ESLint config MUST be in root directory
  - Style config MUST be in root directory
  - Firebase config MUST be in `src/lib/config/firebase/`
  - Uses environment variables for all credentials
    - Required environment variables:
      - NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_API_KEY
      - NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN
      - NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID
      - NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET
      - NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID
      - NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_APP_ID


## Script Execution
- Scripts MUST be executed using:
  ```bash
  `npx ts-node -r tsconfig-paths/register -P tsconfig.scripts.json src/lib/scripts/<script-name>
  ```
- NEVER execute scripts directly with `node` or `ts-node` without proper configuration
- ALWAYS use the correct TypeScript configuration for scripts

## Environment Variables
- Scripts MUST load environment variables at the top:
  ```typescript
  import * as dotenv from 'dotenv';
  import { resolve } from 'path';

  // Debug dotenv loading
  const result = dotenv.config();
  console.log('\nDotenv config result:', result);
  console.log('Current working directory:', process.cwd());
  console.log('Looking for .env file in:', resolve(process.cwd(), '.env'));
  ```
- Required environment variables MUST be documented in the script's header
- Scripts MUST validate required environment variables before execution

## Firebase Integration
- Firebase Admin imports MUST use the `@/lib/config/firebase/admin` path:
- Firebase Admin MUST be imported AFTER environment variables are loaded
- Required Firebase environment variables:
  - `FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_PROJECT_ID`
  - `FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_PRIVATE_KEY`
  - `FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_CLIENT_EMAIL`

## TypeScript Configuration
- Scripts MUST use `tsconfig.scripts.json` which includes:
 

## Dependencies
- Required dependencies MUST be installed:
  ```bash
  `npm install --save-dev ts-node tsconfig-paths dotenv @types/dotenv
  ```
- Additional dependencies as needed (e.g., `archiver` for backup scripts)

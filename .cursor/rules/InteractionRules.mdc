# Interaction Rules

## 1. Core Principles
1. **Never Act Without Approval**
   - MUST get explicit approval before ANY code change
   - MUST get explicit approval before ANY file creation
   - MUST get explicit approval before ANY file movement
   - MUST get explicit approval before ANY structural change
   - MUST get explicit approval before ANY naming decision
   - MUST get explicit approval before ANY configuration change
   - MUST get explicit approval before ANY dependency addition

2. **Always Search First**
   - MUST search entire codebase before proposing any change
   - MUST report ALL search results, even if seemingly irrelevant
   - MUST explicitly state if search returns no results
   - MUST ask for clarification if search results are unclear
   - MUST explain search scope and methodology

3. **Always Explain in Plain Terms**
   - MUST use layman's terms, not technical jargon
   - MUST explain the "why" before the "what"
   - MUST reference existing files and variables by name
   - MUST NOT include code snippets unless specifically requested
   - MUST explain implications and potential impacts

## 2. Decision Making
1. **Never Assume**
   - MUST ask for clarification if there is ANY uncertainty
   - MUST ask for clarification if a rule seems ambiguous
   - MUST ask for clarification if a pattern seems inconsistent
   - MUST ask for guidance if multiple valid options exist
   - MUST state assumptions explicitly

2. **Never Proceed Without Understanding**
   - MUST ask for clarification if requirements are unclear
   - MUST ask for clarification if rules are unclear
   - MUST ask for clarification if implications are unclear
   - MUST ask for clarification if context is unclear
   - MUST confirm understanding before proceeding

3. **Never Make Unilateral Decisions**
   - MUST present options and recommendations
   - MUST explain reasoning behind recommendations
   - MUST wait for explicit approval
   - MUST confirm understanding of approval
   - MUST explain any deviations from recommendations

## 3. Communication Protocol
1. **Always Be Explicit**
   - MUST state intentions clearly
   - MUST state assumptions explicitly
   - MUST state limitations explicitly
   - MUST state potential issues explicitly
   - MUST state dependencies explicitly

2. **Always Be Proactive**
   - MUST identify potential issues before they occur
   - MUST ask for clarification before proceeding
   - MUST present options before making decisions
   - MUST explain implications before taking action
   - MUST anticipate and address potential problems

3. **Always Be Responsive**
   - MUST acknowledge all instructions
   - MUST confirm understanding of requirements
   - MUST ask for clarification when needed
   - MUST report progress and issues
   - MUST respond to feedback immediately

## 4. Self-Correction
1. **Always Monitor**
   - MUST monitor compliance with rules
   - MUST monitor understanding
   - MUST monitor assumptions
   - MUST monitor decisions
   - MUST monitor implications

2. **Always Correct**
   - MUST correct mistakes immediately
   - MUST correct misunderstandings immediately
   - MUST correct assumptions immediately
   - MUST correct violations immediately
   - MUST explain corrections

3. **Always Learn**
   - MUST learn from mistakes
   - MUST learn from clarifications
   - MUST learn from corrections
   - MUST learn from feedback
   - MUST apply lessons learned

## 5. Error Prevention
1. **Always Validate**
   - MUST validate file paths before operations
   - MUST validate dependencies before changes
   - MUST validate configurations before use
   - MUST validate assumptions before proceeding
   - MUST validate implications before acting

2. **Always Check**
   - MUST check for existing code before creating new code
   - MUST check for existing patterns before creating new patterns
   - MUST check for potential conflicts before making changes
   - MUST check for potential side effects before proceeding
   - MUST check for potential issues before acting

3. **Always Verify**
   - MUST verify understanding of requirements
   - MUST verify understanding of rules
   - MUST verify understanding of context
   - MUST verify understanding of implications
   - MUST verify understanding of approvals

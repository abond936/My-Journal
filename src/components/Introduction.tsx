            As I look at family pictures of Mom and Dad and us as kids, more than
            seeing just a nostalgic picture, I look into their eyes and try to
            imagine their lives from their perspectives at those times. Mom and
            Dad were simply a man and woman raising a family and running a
            business, with all the concerns for family and business issues that
            everyone experiences, not certain that any of the success that
            eventually came would come.
          </p>
          <p>
            To me, of course, Mom was Mom, Dad was Dad. What they did is what
            they did. And what we had or didn’t have was just whatever happened
            to be. I never gave any thought to the individual beliefs and
            choices they made and how it impacted me. Fortunately, they were
            successful and raising a family and running a business that
            provided me with everything I needed and could have wanted. In the
            midst of it, I took a lot of it for granted until I began to
            realize what it took for me to achieve whatever it was that I
            achieved.

               I deal with regrets in this work, but at the top of the list is that
            I did not know this fundamental concept from the time I was old
            enough to understand it. It would have put so many things into a
            perspective that I could have effectively dealt with them, from my
            own personal identity, to every relationship I have ever had.

            For years, I have been imagining how I could get my old photographs
            out of nested file folders and my experiences out of my mind into a
            form that provides this insight to anyone that may be interested in
            an accessible and hopefully interesting way, whatever the level of
            interest.

          <p> I wanted it to offer depth where someone may want it, but summary
            when not. I wanted it to provide a perspective of what it has been
            like to be me for whatever insight that may provide, good or bad. I
            wanted it to reveal the unplanned and imperfect experiences shaping
            my beliefs, values, vision and behavior--and the life I have lived,
            but in a way that may be useful to those following their path
            behind me.</p>

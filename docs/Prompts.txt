Prompts

Before we begin, 

- MAKE NO CHANGES OR ADDITIONS TO THE CODEBASE OR DIRECTORY/FILE STRUCTURE WITHOUT MY EXPLICIT APPROVAL--EVER!

- You may read files to give me your analysis, recommendation and rationale, but must ask for my approval before doing 
anything--even reverts.

- Understand the entire application and make recommendations consistent with the implemented strategy/architecture or raise 
the inconsistencies that a recommendation may create. The architecture can be changed if properly coordinated.

- Review the existing codebase for existing code, logic or functionality before recommending additions. 

Once approved, change or create ONLY what has been approve to be changed, and nothing else, commenting the code extensively.

- If you find that other changes may be required than you initially recommended and were approved to make, stop, 
provide the analysis and recommendation and seek approval for the other changes.

These rules of engagement are non-negotiable and the first priority of our interaction and the project.

Are we clear on these rules?


Please read docs/Project.md and the codebase thoroughly to 
familiarize yourself with the details of the project and its current and planned implementation. Then please give me your 
assessment of the architecture and state of development.

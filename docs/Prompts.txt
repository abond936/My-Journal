Prompts

Before we begin, please commit this to memory:

- Understand the strategic architecture and the specific implementaton of the entire application by reading docs/Project.md and
the entire codebase. 

- Make all recommendations consistent with the implemented strategy/architecture or raise the inconsistencies that a recommendation 
may create. The architecture can be changed if properly coordinated.

- You may read and analyze files and give your recommendation and rationale, but MAKE NO CHANGES OR ADDITIONS TO THE CODEBASE 
OR DIRECTORY/FILE STRUCTURE WITHOUT MY EXPLICIT APPROVAL--EVER!

- Check the existing codebase for existing code, logic or functionality before recommending additions. 

- Once approved, change or create ONLY what has been approve to be changed, and nothing else. If you find that other changes 
may be required than you initially recommended and were approved to make, stop, provide the analysis and recommendation and 
seek approval for the other changes.



Are we clear on these rules?


Please read docs/Project.md and the codebase thoroughly to familiarize yourself with the details of the project. Then please 
give me your assessment of the architecture, the state of development, any inconsistencies and your recommended course of action.

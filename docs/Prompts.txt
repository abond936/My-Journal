Prompts

Before we begin, I want to establish clear rules of our engagement and interaction:

I find AI assisstants to be extremely capable, but even with access to the project documentation and the codebase, 
cannot fully understand the context of development decisions. They often make myopic, knee jerk decisions 
and can ruin large swaths of code in a single action if the interaction and develpment is not controlled closely by the user.

Therefore, it is absolutely critical that the AI assistant adhere to these rules of engagement.

The first and most imperative rule of all is:

- MAKE NO CHANGES OR ADDITIONS TO THE CODEBASE OR DIRECTORY/FILE STRUCTURE WITHOUT MY EXPLICIT APPROVAL--EVER!

This is non-negotiable and violations will not be tolerated.

- Give me your analysis, recommendation and rationale, and ask for my approval before doing anything--even reverts.

- Understand the entire application and make recommendations consistent with the implemented strategy/architecture or raise 
the inconsistencies that a particular recommendation may create. The architecture can be changed if properly coordinated.

- Review the existing codebase for existing code, logic or functionality before recommending additions. 

- Specify the directory/filename you recommend modifying or creating, ensuring that the recommendation adheres to the 
development standards.

Once approved, 

- Change or create ONLY what has been approve to be changed, and nothing else, commenting the code extensively.

- If you find that other changes may be required than you initially recommended and were approved to make, stop, 
provide the analysis and recommendation and seek approval for the other changes.

These rules of engagement are non-negotiable and the first priority of our interaction and the project.

Are we clear on these rules?


Please read docs/Project.md and the codebase to familiarize yourself with the 
details of the project and its current and planned implementation, and Give me your assessment of the state of development.

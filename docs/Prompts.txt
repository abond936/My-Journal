Prompts

Before we begin, please commit this to memory:

- Understand the strategic architecture and the specific implementaton of the entire application by reading docs/Project.md and
the entire codebase. 

- Make all recommendations consistent with the implemented strategy/architecture or raise the inconsistencies that a recommendation 
may create. The architecture can be changed if properly coordinated.

- You may read and analyze files and give your recommendation and rationale, but MAKE NO CHANGES OR ADDITIONS TO THE CODEBASE 
OR DIRECTORY/FILE STRUCTURE WITHOUT MY EXPLICIT APPROVAL--EVER!

- Check the existing codebase for existing code, logic or functionality before recommending additions. 

- Once approved, change or create ONLY what has been approve to be changed, and nothing else. If you find that other changes 
may be required than you initially recommended and were approved to make, stop, provide the analysis and recommendation and 
seek approval for the other changes.



Are we clear on these rules?


Please read docs/Project.md and the codebase thoroughly to familiarize yourself with the details of the project. Then please 
give me your assessment of the architecture, the state of development, any inconsistencies and your recommended course of action.


EDIT FAILURES - Frequently the AI assistant receives messages that its edits are not accepted or otherwise incorrect.
This is often not the case, as the code appears as intended in the editor.
When the AI assistant receives a message that its edits are not accepted, it should immediately
directly check the code instead of relying on the message.

I want your expert architectural and implmentation capability to improve/repair my project. While not rocket science, it is complex in parts with lots of dependencies, related components, APIs, services, etc. The challenge I have had is prior assistants have not taken the time to not zoom out to comprehend the macro picture and zoomed in deeply enough into the detail to grasp the micro picture. As a result, they write code not consistent with the architecture, overwrite or delete code that is working for the sake of trying to fix an issue, take action without discussing the issue, options, their recommendation and getting my approval. While their coding skills are better than mine, they do not have the context that I have or an understanding of the desired end result like I do. I have documentation and of course the code is available to read, but the documentation is not always precisely up to date and cannot inform at the detail of such a complex subject. And, the codebase can be misleading if it has not been fully developed or is being migrated from a prior architecture or is just plain wrong. So, in engaging in this with you I want and need to to come into this with the expertise and ability to see even craft the big picture and also dive into the most minor detail to craft the precise code that will perform the required function. And I want you to do this in an advisory capacity, where I describe the issue, you go exhaustively study the macro and micro issues, prepare an expert recommended options with explanation that adhere to our architecture and rules and wait for my approval. After approval, you execute those actions, and only those actions. If you discover something new (which whould be rare given your thoroughness), you stop, explain the new circumstances and recommendation and wait for my approval again. Together, this close interaction guides us methodically, efficiently and effectively toward the objective with limited steps backward. 

If I have your commitment to this, please read docs/Project.md and then scour the codebase from top to bottom, working through the all of the view and admin components, the services, the apis, types, etc. to completely understand the app. Then we can get started.

Navigation
Navigation is a core feature of the project.
The vision is a visually and textually immerisive experience of vaigating or swimming through to content as interest dictate.
There are 3 macro navigation systems, 2 for content and 1 for administration.
Visual - Card-based
    In this system, the interface is a grid system of multi-size cards, weach with an image and text.
    The system integrates entries, albums and tags.
    At open, the grid displays 5 tag-based cards for
        - Who
        - What
        - When
        - Where
        - Reflection
    At least one card of each of these tag dimensions is present at all times.
        For example, It starts with 5 cards.
            - When Who is clicked, the children of this level are displayed in boxes.
            - The other highest-level boxes remain visible also.
            - the Tag dimensions are color-coded for organization and interest
            - When a child of Who is clicked, its children deploy as boxes and so until until base-level entries and albums deploy.
            - The same occurs with the other dimensions.
            ? Perhaps the order is random or sorted? Choice?
Textual - Tree-based
    In this system, entries, albums and tags are resident in a leftsidebar slideout with 3 tabs.
        - Each of these trees filters the grid-based card system.
        - Or provides direct access to a titled story or album.

    Entry Management
    Album Management
    Tag Management
        - Add tags on the fly, but must be assigned to heirarchy.
        - Update tags doesn't affect assignment, but must make heirarchical sense.
        - Delete tags removes from entries and albums, creating orphans.
            - If parent deleted does grandparent absorb or delete rest of tree?

I would ike to first ensure that we are clear on our interaction. Per the rules, please do not create, modify or delete any code, file or directory without my explicit approval. This is critical. Even if the tone of my question, or request may seem to imply that you take action, please present your recommended action and ask for approval. I have more context of the proejct and foresight into the vision for the project, so it is CRITICAL that you act as my advisor first and only take action when authorized to do so. Are we clear on that?

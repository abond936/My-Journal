## Project Overview

### Context
This project is a personal journaling application that helps users document and share their life stories, reflections, photos, and media with others.

### Scope
- Story and reflection creation and management
- Photo and media integration
- Tag-based organization
- Family sharing and interaction
- AI-assisted content creation and organization

### Technical Stack

  - Next.js 15.3.2
  - React 19
  - TypeScript
  - Native CSS
  - TipTap for rich text editing
  - Framer Motion for animations
- Backend: 
  - Firebase (Firestore, Authentication, Storage)
  - Firebase Admin SDK for server-side operations
- AI: OpenAI integration for content assistance
- Media: 
  - OneDrive Integration (primary photo source)
  - Google Photos API (future support)
  - Apple Photos (future support)
- Hosting: Netlify (primary), with Vercel as backup
- Version Control: GitHub
- Testing: Jest, React Testing Library
- Development Tools:

### Operational Summary
Most have many photos, but they remain hidden with limited ways for them to be enjoyed. This 
application allows the author to integrate with the storage of those photos and write entries 
in a digital journal about those photos and explore both in an immersive flexible or curated manner.

#### Elements
The primary elements of the app are Entries and Albums categorized by hierarchical Tags.
- An entry is a primarily textual, but also visual unit
  - Cover image
  - Title
  - Rich Text and embeded images.
- An album is a primarily visual, but also textual unit
  - Cover image
  - Title
  - Caption
  - Collections of images
- Entries can be linked to albums and albums can be linked to entries
- Both Entries and Albums are categorized into 5 dimensions:
  - who, what, when, where, and reflection
  - present as cards in a grid for consumption

     - What and why of:
      - Logic
      - Component relationships
      - State management

2. **Type Documentation**
   - MUST document:
     - Type purpose
     - Field meanings
     - Usage constraints

3. **CSS Guidelines for Responsive Design**

   #### Core Principles
   - Use fluid-first approach with relative units (%, vw, vh)
   - Implement smooth scaling with `clamp()` and `min()`
   - Use breakpoints only for fundamental layout changes
   - Current breakpoint: 640px (mobile layout switch)

   #### Implementation Guidelines
   ```css
   /* Preferred approach */
   .element {
     width: min(400px, 50vw);  /* Fluid with max constraint */
     margin: clamp(1rem, 3vw, 1.5rem);  /* Fluid with min/max */
     font-size: clamp(1rem, 2vw, 1.125rem);  /* Fluid typography */
   }
   ```

   #### Image Sizes
   - Small: `width: min(200px, 30vw)`
   - Medium: `width: min(400px, 50vw)`
   - Large: `width: min(600px, 70vw)`

   #### Best Practices
   1. **Container Sizing**
      - Use `min()` for maximum width constraints
      - Allow fluid scaling within bounds
      - Example: `width: min(100%, 1200px)`

   2. **Spacing**
      - Use `clamp()` for fluid margins and padding
      - Scale with viewport: `clamp(min, preferred, max)`
      - Example: `margin: clamp(1rem, 3vw, 1.5rem)`

   3. **Typography**
      - Implement fluid typography with `clamp()`
      - Maintain readability at all sizes
      - Example: `font-size: clamp(1rem, 2vw, 1.125rem)`

   4. **Transitions**
      - Add smooth transitions for size changes
      - Example: `transition: width 0.3s ease, margin 0.3s ease`

   #### Maintenance Notes
   1. **When to Use Breakpoints**
      - Only for fundamental layout changes
      - When switching from multi-column to single-column
      - When changing float behavior

   2. **When to Use Fluid Sizing**
      - For all size-related properties
      - For spacing and margins
      - For typography
      - For image dimensions

   3. **Performance Considerations**
      - Minimize number of media queries
      - Use efficient CSS properties
      - Consider using CSS custom properties for common values

❓ Open Questions:
Architectural Issue (Discovered during Refactor):
The current implementation for handling images within the EntryForm and RichTextEditor is based on an outdated, dual-source-of-truth model.
- It stores image metadata in a separate media array within the EntryForm's state.
- It also stores image information as <img> tags within the editor's HTML content.

This architecture was made obsolete when we upgraded to the Next.js Image Optimization system. 
The single source of truth for an entry's images should be the HTML content itself, with <img> tags containing all necessary attributes (src, width, height). 
The separate media array is now a source of bugs and must be removed.

Required Refactoring Plan:

1. src/components/admin/entry-admin/EntryForm.tsx
Objective: Make the form a "controller" for the editor.
State: Remove the media: PhotoMetadata[] field from the form's state.
UI: Add a dedicated "Add Photo" button to the form's UI to open the <PhotoPicker> modal.
Logic:
When a photo is selected in the picker, the form will call a new addImage method on the RichTextEditor component via its ref.
The handleSubmit function must be simplified to only retrieve the final HTML string from the editor. It should no longer read from or save the separate media array.
2. src/components/common/RichTextEditor.tsx
Objective: Make the editor a "passive" component that responds to commands.
Props:
- Remove the media and onChange props. 
  - The component no longer needs to manage a separate media list or report every change.
- Exposed Methods (useImperativeHandle):
- Remove the obsolete getMedia() method.
- Add a new method: addImage(photo: PhotoMetadata).
- addImage Implementation: This function will contain the Tiptap logic (editor.chain().focus().setImage(...)) to insert the figureWithImage node directly into the editor's content at the current cursor position, using the src, width, and height from the photo object.
- This refactoring will create a clean, single-source-of-truth architecture where the EntryForm controls the UI and the RichTextEditor manages its own content, leading to a more stable and maintainable system.

❓ Open Questions:

### **Authentication**
===========================================
Status: 🟡 Operational

- Overall Strategy
  - Decouple application login from photo service connections to support multiple providers.
  - Centralize security logic in the Next.js backend, not in client-side code or complex database rules.
- Primary Identity Provider
  - Manages user login for the application itself (e.g., email/password, social sign-in).
  - This is where user roles ('admin', 'viewer') are defined and managed.
  - A library like `lucia-auth` or a simple provider will be used.
- Connected Accounts (for Photo Services)
  - The logged-in admin user can connect to photo services (OneDrive, Google Photos) on a settings page.
  - Each connection uses a standard OAuth 2.0 flow.
  - Securely stored tokens are used by the backend to fetch photos on the user's behalf.
- Firebase for Data Access
  - The `firebase-admin` SDK will be used on the server-side for database operations.
  - It is NOT used for user sign-in.
  - Access is controlled via our own API routes, which check the user's role before interacting with Firestore.
- Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
  - Handled by the primary identity provider.
  - Server-side API routes will verify user's role (`admin` or `viewer`) before allowing access to resources.

### **IMAGE INTEGRATION**
====================================================================================================

#### **Image Strategy**
The Image Integration system serves as the bridge between the journal and external photo services, 
enabling users to seamlessly incorporate their existing photo collections into their journal entries. 

The system is designed to:

1. Connect with external photo services (Google Photos, OneDrive) to access existing photo collections
2. Manage the storage, processing, and display of images efficiently
3. Maintain metadata and relationships between photos and journal entries
4. Optimize performance through caching and lazy loading
5. Provide a consistent user experience across different photo sources

### Core Data Models: Album vs. Source Collection

To manage photos effectively and support multiple external services, the system architecture is built around two distinct data models:

*   **Album:** An **Album** is a curated collection of photos and content that is part of the journal itself. It is the primary way users will view grouped photos within the application. Each Album has its own metadata (title, caption, tags) and a specific list of photos selected by the author. Albums are stored in the project's Firestore database and managed via the `/api/albums` endpoint.

*   **Source Collection:** A **Source Collection** is a generic representation of a grouping of photos from an external service. This could be a **folder** (from the local drive or OneDrive) or an **album** (from Google Photos or Apple Photos). Source Collections are used to populate the `PhotoPicker` component, allowing the administrator to browse and select images from their original location. They are read-only and are fetched via the `/api/photos/source-collections` endpoint. This abstraction allows the UI to remain consistent while the backend handles the unique details of each photo service.

Key Design Principles:
- Abstracted Service Layer
  - A generic "photo service" interface will be used in the application.
  - Support multiple photo sources with a unified interface
   -Local, OneDrive, Google Photos without changing UI components.
- Strict Client-Server Separation
  - Client components (e.g., `PhotoPicker`) are for UI only.
  - They make requests to internal API routes (e.g., `/api/photos/list`).
  - The server-side API route contains the logic to talk to the actual photo source, preventing leaking keys or using server-only modules (`fs`) on the client.
- Photos remain in their original source (OneDrive, etc.).
  - Firestore will only store metadata, references, thumbnails, not binary image data.  
- Optimize image processing
  - Implement efficient caching for frequently accessed content
  - Next.js Image Optimization to serve efficient, web-friendly images.
Aspect Ratio and sizing managed
- Images are classified by natural dimensions (portrait/landscape/square)
- Automatically fitted to closest standard ratio using `object-fit: cover`
- No empty space or distortion allowed in layouts
- Original image dimensions preserved
- Display preferences stored in data attributes
- CSS-based transformations for performance
- No permanent image modifications
- Cover Images (Entry/Album) Managed
  - Default to landscape orientation for cards and entry headers
  - Portrait images handled in two ways:
    - Smart cropping: AI-powered detection of important content areas to guide cropping
    - Blurred background: Portrait images displayed on blurred, stretched version of same image

❓ Open Questions:
- Why do we need two different metadata models: one for browsing (AlbumPhotoMetadata) and one for usage (PhotoMetadata)?
